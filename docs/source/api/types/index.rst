Available Types
===============

This page is about Crunpyroll Types. All types listed here are available through the ``crunpyroll.types`` package.
Unless required as argument to a client method, most of the types don't need to be manually instantiated because they
are only returned by other methods. You also don't need to import them, unless you want to type-hint your variables.
